C++11 has introduced three types of smart pointers, which are defined in the header of the standard library:

The unique pointer std::unique_ptr is a smart pointer which exclusively owns a dynamically allocated resource on the heap. There must not be a second unique pointer to the same resource.

The shared pointer std::shared_ptr points to a heap resource but does not explicitly own it. There may even be several shared pointers to the same resource, each of which will increase an internal reference count. As soon as this count reaches zero, the resource will automatically be deallocated.

The weak pointer std::weak_ptr behaves similar to the shared pointer but does not increase the reference counter.
