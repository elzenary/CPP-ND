what is the size for virtual memory allocated for c++ program
what is the stack and heap size 
is it possible to increase this space in runtime

To increase stack size you need to use special compilation flag or #pragma
Example gcc -Wl,--stack,4194304 -o program program.c

the heap is almost always extended dynamically by asking the OS for more memory as needed.
 On some embedded platforms, or some very old platforms this may not be true, 
 process relies on the OS to tell it that it can't have any more memory.
