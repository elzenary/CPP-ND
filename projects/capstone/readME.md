Step 1: Proposed Project
mini bank system simulation

Step 2: Scope the Project
add user database contains userName, hashed password  and balance
provide the operations to userRegisters and loginUser
provide admin panel with previlage to control different users
provide user panel to withdraw deposit and balance checking
all the changes should be reflected in the users database
the database is implemented as a file and the program read and write inside it

Step 3: Build your application
the application can be found in /src folder

Step 4: Document Your Work
nstructions for running the project

an overview of your code structure

an explanation of how your submission satisfies the necessary rubric
rubric point addressed
A variety of control structures are used in the project.
The project code is clearly organized into functions.
The project reads data from an external file or writes data to a file as part of the necessary operation of the program.
The project accepts input from a user as part of the necessary operation of the program.
The project code is organized into classes with class attributes to hold the data, and class methods to perform tasks.
