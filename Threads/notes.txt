concurrent programming means many thing happen at the same time
if multi cpu system then it is real
if single cpu then it is illusion 
concurrency can be done in both cases
processes managed by os and have different address spaace and have overhead but used in distrubted systems
threads are light process within one process ease od use
shared data synchronization must be ensured during threads because it is programmer responsibility
g++ --std=c++11  -pthread example.cpp ./a.out
